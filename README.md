# Machine Learning for Tweet Sentiment Detection with H2O
## Submitted for ENVS803

The scripts folder contains the R scripts for querying the Twitter API, creating the W2V and GBM models, and some helper functions.

The .Rmd file in the main folder may be compiled using `rmarkdown::render('index.Rmd')` and will use the saved models. To use updated models from the w2v script, the file will have to be edited with the paths of the new binaries.
